        <p>The <strong>Database Management System </strong>(DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. <br>
            The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. <br>
            The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a "database system". 
            <br>Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.</p>
