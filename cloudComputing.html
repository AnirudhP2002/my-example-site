        <p><strong>Cloud computing</strong> is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.<br>
             Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. 
             <br>Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, typically using a "pay-as-you-go" model which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware users.</p>
